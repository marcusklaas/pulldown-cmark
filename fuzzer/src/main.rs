//! This is a fuzzer for pulldown-cmark, which tries to detect super-linear parsing behaviour.
//! Additionally it can detect panicks of pulldown-cmark.
//!
//! The general idea is to extract relevant literals from the pulldown-cmark source code
//! (see the `literals` module).
//! Short random combinations of literals are generated (like concatenating 6 random literals),
//! which are called patterns.
//! Those patterns are repeated until they reach a byte-length of `NUM_BYTES`.
//! We iterate over subslices of the pattern to get `SAMPLE_SIZE` evenly distributed
//! (len, time)-pairs.
//! Those pairs are fed into a scoring function to test if they seem to be linear or might be
//! super-linear (see the `scoring` module).
//! All of this is performed in parallel on multiple threads.
//!
//! Unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world, where linear patterns produce a perfect line.
//! instead we need to deal with large outliers, e.g. if a thread is rescheduled while performing
//! time measurements.
//! Therefore, we have a sort-of two pass system.
//! The first pass doesn't perform any outlier detection / handling.
//! This is because outlier handling is pretty slow.
//! The first pass just assumes there aren't any outliers, calculates `SAMPLE_SIZE` points and
//! applies the scoring functions to them.
//! This filters out most patterns already.
//! If however possible non-linear behaviour is found, we perform the second pass.
//! In the second pass, we double the `SAMPLE_SIZE`, because more points make for higher precision
//! in the scoring functions.
//! Additionally, we assume that the (len, time)-pairs interpreted as coordinates on a graph  are
//! strictly monotonously increasing.
//! If we encounter a time-value, which is larger than the next time value, that'll probably be an
//! outlier.
//! As such, if we encounter such a value, we'll re-time it.
//! To prevent further edge-cases, we always align the tested input to pattern boundaries.
//!
//! Additionally, we abort if parsing took longer than `MAX_MILLIS`.
//! If we tested a substring of the whole input, and already exceeded `MAX_MILLIS`, we shouldn't
//! continue testing with longer inputs, as we might have super-linear behaviour.
//! Instead, we again print an according message and abort with that pattern.
//!
//! There can also be cases where either the fuzzer or the parser takes a very long time testing
//! a single pattern or ends up in an infinite loop.
//! If the time a thread spends on a single pattern exceeds `10 * MAX_MILLIS`, it could indicate
//! bugs in the fuzzer, extremely long parsing of an input, or maybe even an infinite loop.
//! As such we report the pattern the thread currently works on.
//! To kill that thread and not let it be stuck in a possibly inifinite loop forever, we restart
//! the whole process (by executing `exec` with our own binary).
//! While there are other ways of killing threads / handling infinite loops, as evaluated in
//! <https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark/pull/286#issuecomment-490315582>,
//! the easiest solution is to just restart the whole process.
